    Hadoop - Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and
    run applications that process vast amounts of data.

SYNOPSIS
    Usage: hadoop [--config confdir] COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
    Here's what makes Hadoop especially useful:

    Scalable
        Hadoop can reliably store and process petabytes.

    Economical
        It distributes the data and processing across clusters of commonly
        available computers. These clusters can number into the thousands of
        nodes.

    Efficient
        By distributing the data, Hadoop can process it in parallel on the
        nodes where the data is located. This makes it extremely rapid.

    Reliable
        Hadoop automatically maintains multiple copies of data and
        automatically redeploys computing tasks based on failures.

    Hadoop implements MapReduce, using the Hadoop Distributed File System
    (HDFS) (see figure below.) MapReduce divides applications into many
    small blocks of work. HDFS creates multiple replicas of data blocks for
    reliability, placing them on compute nodes around the cluster. MapReduce
    can then process the data where it is located.

    For more details about hadoop, see the Hadoop Wiki at
    http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/.

FILES
    /etc/hadoop/conf
        This symbolic link points to the currently active Hadoop
        configuration directory.

        Note to Hadoop System Admins
                The "/etc/hadoop/conf" link is managed by the
                alternatives(8) command so you should not change this
                symlink directly.

                To see what current alternative(8) Hadoop configurations you
                have, run the following command:

                 # alternatives --display hadoop
                 hadoop - status is auto.
                  link currently points to /etc/hadoop/conf.pseudo
                 /etc/hadoop/conf.empty - priority 10
                 /etc/hadoop/conf.pseudo - priority 30
                 Current `best' version is /etc/hadoop/conf.pseudo.

                This shows that the link point to "/etc/hadoop/conf.pseudo"
                (for the Hadoop Pseudo-Distributed configuration).

                To add a new custom configuration, run the following
                commands as root:

                 # cp -r /etc/hadoop/conf.empty /etc/hadoop/conf.my

                This will create a new configuration directory,
                "/etc/hadoop/conf.my", that serves as a starting point for a
                new configuration. Edit the configuration files in
                "/etc/hadoop/conf.my" until you have the configuration you
                want.

                To activate your new configuration and see the new
                configuration list:

                 # alternatives --install /etc/hadoop/conf hadoop /etc/hadoop/conf.my 90

                You can verify your new configuration is active by runnning
                the following:

                 # alternatives --display hadoop
                 hadoop - status is auto.
                  link currently points to /etc/hadoop/conf.my
                 /etc/hadoop/conf.empty - priority 10
                 /etc/hadoop/conf.pseudo - priority 30
                 /etc/hadoop/conf.my - priority 90
                 Current `best' version is /etc/hadoop/conf.my.

                At this point, it might be a good idea to restart your
                services with the new configuration, e.g.,

                 # /etc/init.d/hadoop-namenode restart

    /etc/hadoop/conf/hadoop-site.xml
        This is the path to the currently deployed Hadoop site
        configuration. See "/etc/hadoop/conf" above.

    /usr/bin/hadoop-config.sh
        This script searches for a useable "JAVA_HOME" location if
        "JAVA_HOME" is not already set. It also sets up environment
        variables that Hadoop components need at startup (see "ENVIRONMENT"
        section).

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-namenode
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop NameNode

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-datanode
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop DataNode

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-secondarynamenode
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop Secondary
        NameNode

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-jobtracker
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop JobTracker

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-tasktracker
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop TaskTracker

ENVIRONMENT
    JAVA_HOME
        Hadoop will honor the location of your "JAVA_HOME" environment
        variable. Hadoop requires Sun Java 1.6 which can be downloaded from
        http://java.sun.com.

    HADOOP_HOME
        The location of the Hadoop jar files are by default in
        "/usr/lib/hadoop". You can change the location with this environment
        variable (not recommeded).

    HADOOP_CONF_DIR
        The location of the Hadoop configuration files. Defaults to
        "/etc/hadoop/conf". For more details, see the "FILES" section.

    HADOOP_LOG_DIR
        All Hadoop services log to "/var/log/hadoop" by default. You can
        change the location with this environment variable.

EXAMPLES
     $ mkdir input
     $ cp <txt files> input
     $ hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop/*example*.jar input output 'grep string'
     $ cat output/*
