This directory contains scripts for managing the Cloudera APT repository.

The authoritative repository currently lives on S3 in the cloudera-apt bucket.
We actually serve it out of apache on community.cloudera.com. The reason for this
is that people expect to be able to navigate apt repository directory indexes, and
that's a lot easier to accomplish through Apache.

== How to initialize an entirely fresh repository ==

mkdir -p repo/conf
./gen_distributions.py > repo/conf/distributions
cp header.shtml repo/conf/header.shtml
cp htaccess repo/.htaccess
cp archive.key repo/

reprepro -b repo export

== How to update the repository ==

1. Start up a Debian Lenny EC2 instance

  ec2-run-instances -k $USER -g cloudera -g $USER ami-e348af8a

we refer to the public hostname of this instance as $EC2_HOST from now on

2. Bootstrap the machine (creates 'apt' user, copies scripts, etc)

  ./apt/remote_machine_setup.sh $EC2_HOST

3. Login as the newly created 'apt' user (your key is already installed in
   authorized_keys)

  ssh apt@$EC2_HOST

4. Sync the current repository off S3

  s3cmd sync s3://cloudera-apt/debian/ repo/

5. Update the repository from a build you've done using ec2_build.py. The build
   id is printed on ec2_build.py exit. Make sure you watch in ElasticFox to make sure
   all of your build slaves have shut themselves down. This indicates success. If
   one is still up, the build must of failed. ssh into the bad build slave and
   check out /var/log/message

  ./update_repo.sh ec2-build <your build id>

   This script will ask for a GPG key passphrase. Owing to new Cloudera policies not
   to put passwords in the wiki, ask Todd for this one.

6. Sync repository back up into S3 (your AWS credentials are already installed on that machine)

  s3cmd sync -P repo/ s3://cloudera-apt/debian/

7. This has updated the repository in s3, but *not* the actual archive.cloudera.com
   repository, which is hosted by Apache. To do that:

  ssh community.cloudera.com
  sudo -s
  [set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY variables]
  cd /ebs/apt
  s3sync.rb --make-dirs -r cloudera-apt:debian/ debian.new/
  chmod 644 `find debian.new -type f`
  chmod 755 `find debian.new -type d`
  rsync -avn debian.new/ debian/

  # make sure the dry run looked reasonable
  rsync -av debian.new/ debian/

   The reason for the wacky s3sync-then-chmod-then-rsync is that the version of s3sync.rb on
   community is totally whack and sets file permissions completely crazily.

  *NOTE*: Don't update the production repository on a whim. After you've released some version,
  we have to assume that some users migth have installed it. Re-releasing that version with a
  different hash is practically impossible (it will scream loudly at all points in the process)


== Hosting the repository ==

The repository is currently a vhost on community.cloudera.com.
The requirements are:
  - Deploy apt.httpd.conf in /etc/httpd/conf.d/
  - Make sure mod_include is enabled by running a2enmod include
  - The repository should be deployed in /ebs/apt
  - index.html from this directory should be copied to /ebs/apt/index.html
