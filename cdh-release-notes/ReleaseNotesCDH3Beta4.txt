      Cloudera's Distribution for Hadoop (CDH) 3 Beta 4 Released

   Cloudera is happy to announce that we have released beta 4 of
   version 3 of our Distribution for Hadoop (CDH3 beta 4).

   == Core Hadoop, HDFS, and MapReduce ==

   As the final beta in the CDH3 series, the major changes in this release
   have focused on stability, security, and scalability.

   Stability and bug fixes:

   CDH3 beta 4 fixes several important bugs in both MapReduce and HDFS based
   on our experiences deploying CDH3 in production environments as well as
   important backports from the upstream Apache project. We have also included
   several improvements that ease the diagnosis of configuration problems
   and simplify the configuration of permissions for local storage directories.

   Security:

   CDH3 beta 4 includes a fix for one major security vulnerability that was
   known in beta 3. We encourage users running in a secured environment to
   upgrade as soon as possible.

   Scalability:

   CDH3 beta 4 merges many of the scalability improvements contributed by
   Yahoo! in their 0.20.100 branch of Apache Hadoop. This includes a reduction
   in the amount of memory required by the NameNode, improvements to MapReduce
   scheduling throughput, and more scalable RPC servers.


   == New Component Versions ==

   Beta 4 updates several components to new upstream version numbers:

   HBase: Updated from 0.89.20100924 to 0.90.1. This new release continues
   to focus on stability, but also includes a few important performance
   improvements and an experimental feature to reduce the frequency of
   length garbage collection pauses.

   ZooKeeper: Updated from 3.3.1 to 3.3.2. This is a bug fix release that
   addresses several important bugs, including two fixes for connection
   cleanup in clients, and one server side thread leak.

   Flume: Updated from 0.9.0 to 0.9.3

   Pig: Updated from 0.7.0 to 0.8.0

   Hive: Updated from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0 - TODO - 0.7.0?

   Sqoop: Updated from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0

   Oozie: Updated from 2.2.1 to 2.3.0. This release includes several usability 
   improvements and bug fixes. New features include Oozie sharelib and Oozie
   HTTP Kerberos authentication. Oozie sharelib bundles Hadoop streaming, Pig,
   Hive and Sqoop JARs simplifying workflow application deployment. Oozie HTTP
   Kerberos authentication provides secure authentication for Oozie clients and
   the Oozie web-console. Oozie examples have been rewritten making them simpler.

   Whirr: Updated from 0.1.0 to 0.3.0. This release includes support for Apache
   HBase, improvements in startup time, and recipes for common configurations.

   Hue: Updated from 1.1 to 1.2. The 1.2.0 is a minor release, largely
   focused on bug fixes and compatibility with the release of Cloudera's
   Distribution for Hadoop 3, beta 4.

   == Upgrading ==

   *** If you are upgrading from a release of CDH prior to CDH3 beta 3, please
   be sure to read the release notes for that release as well as those
   for CDH3 beta 4.

   - This release changes the wire format for Hadoop's RPC mechanism.
   Thus, you must upgrade any existing hadoop client software at the
   same time as you upgrade the server.
