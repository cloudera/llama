Building Llama

* Requirements

  * JDK 1.6+
  
  * Maven 3.0.3+
  
  * Thrift 0.9.0
  
  * Clover license (optional)
  
* Building and Testing

  Common Maven goals: <<<clean, compile, test, package & install>>>.

* Running a Clover Report

+----+
$ mvn clean test -Pclover clover2:aggregate clover2:clover
+----+

  The resulting report will be available at <<<target/clover/index.html>>>.

  <<NOTE:>> A clover license file must be present at <<<~/.clover.license>>>.
  If the license is a different location use 
  <<<-Dclover.license.file=FULL_PATH>>>. Cloudera's Clover license is available
  at <<<dev-support/clover.license>>>.
  
* Building the Documentation
  
+----+
$  mvn site
+----+

  The resulting documentation will be available at <<<target/site/index.html>>>.

  To have a live site while editing APT pages:
  
+----+
$  mvn site:run 
+----+

* Building a Distribution Tarball

+----+
$  mvn clean package site site:stage assembly:single
+----+

  To include the <<<MockLlamaAM>>> in the distribution use the 
  <<<-PdistWithMock>>> profile when running Maven.

  The resulting tarball (and expanded version) will be available at 
  <<<llama-dist/target/llama-dist-${project.version}.tar.gz>>>.

* To Update the Version of the Project

  Run:

+----+
$  mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<NEW_VERSION>
+----+
